    "Q1: Can we use Bagging for regression problems?\n",
    "Answer: Yes, Bagging works for regression. It trains multiple regressors on bootstrapped samples and averages their predictions to reduce variance and improve stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "=====================================================================================================================\n",
    "Q2: What is the difference between multiple model training and single model training?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "- Single model training: Relies on one model, which may overfit or underfit.\n",
    "- Multiple model training (ensemble): Combines several models to reduce bias and variance, improving generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "=====================================================================================================================\n",
    "Q3: Explain the concept of feature randomness in Random Forest.\n",
    "Answer: Random Forest introduces randomness by selecting a random subset of features at each split. This decorrelates trees, increases diversity, and enhances predictive performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "=====================================================================================================================\n",
    "Q4: What is OOB (Out-of-Bag) Score?\n",
    "Answer: The OOB score is an internal validation metric. It uses data not included in the bootstrap sample to test accuracy, giving an unbiased estimate of model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "=====================================================================================================================\n",
    "Q5: How can you measure the importance of features in a Random Forest model?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "- Mean decrease in impurity (Gini importance).\n",
    "- Permutation importance (measuring prediction error increase when feature values are shuffled).\n",
    "\n",
    "=====================================================================================================================\n",
    "Q6: Explain the working principle of a Bagging Classifier.\n",
    "Answer: A Bagging Classifier trains multiple base classifiers on bootstrapped samples and combines their predictions through majority voting, reducing variance and improving accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "=====================================================================================================================\n",
    "Q7: How do you evaluate a Bagging Classifier’s performance?\n",
    "Answer: By using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and OOB score. Cross-validation can also be applied for robust evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "=====================================================================================================================\n",
    "Q8: How does a Bagging Regressor work?\n",
    "Answer: It trains multiple regressors on bootstrapped samples and averages their outputs. This reduces variance and improves prediction stability compared to a single regressor.\n",
    "\n",
    "=====================================================================================================================\n",
    "Q9: What is the main advantage of ensemble techniques?\n",
    "Answer: They combine multiple models to achieve higher accuracy, robustness, and generalization compared to individual models.\n",
    "\n",
    "=====================================================================================================================\n",
    "Q10: What is the main challenge of ensemble methods?\n",
    "Answer: They can be computationally expensive, harder to interpret, and may require more memory and training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "=====================================================================================================================\n",
    "Q11: Explain the key idea behind ensemble techniques.\n",
    "Answer: The key idea is to combine multiple weak or strong learners to create a more powerful model that reduces bias, variance, or both.\n",
    "\n",
    "=====================================================================================================================\n",
    "Q12: What is a Random Forest Classifier?\n",
    "Answer: It is an ensemble of decision trees trained on bootstrapped samples with feature randomness, combining predictions via majority voting for classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "=====================================================================================================================\n",
    "Q13: What are the main types of ensemble techniques?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "- Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating).\n",
    "- Boosting (e.g., AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting).\n",
    "- Stacking (meta-learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "=====================================================================================================================\n",
    "Q14: What is ensemble learning in machine learning?\n",
    "Answer: Ensemble learning is the process of combining multiple models to improve predictive performance, robustness, and generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "=====================================================================================================================\n",
    "Q15: When should we avoid using ensemble methods?\n",
    "Answer: Avoid when:\n",
    "- Data is small and simple (single model suffices).\n",
    "- Interpretability is crucial.\n",
    "- Computational resources are limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "=====================================================================================================================\n",
    "Q16: How does Bagging help in reducing overfitting?\n",
    "Answer: Bagging reduces overfitting by averaging predictions from multiple models trained on different bootstrapped samples, lowering variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "=====================================================================================================================\n",
    "Q17: Why is Random Forest better than a single Decision Tree?\n",
    "Answer: Random Forest reduces overfitting, improves accuracy, and provides more stable predictions by combining multiple decorrelated trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "=====================================================================================================================\n",
    "Q18: What is the role of bootstrap sampling in Bagging?\n",
    "Answer: Bootstrap sampling creates diverse training sets by sampling with replacement, ensuring model diversity and reducing variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "=====================================================================================================================\n",
    "Q19: What are some real-world applications of ensemble techniques?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "- Fraud detection in banking.\n",
    "- Spam filtering in emails.\n",
    "- Medical diagnosis.\n",
    "- Stock market prediction.\n",
    "- Recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "=====================================================================================================================\n",
    "Q20: What is the difference between Bagging and Boosting?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "- Bagging: Builds models independently on bootstrapped samples and aggregates results (reduces variance).\n",
    "- Boosting: Builds models sequentially, each correcting errors of the previous one (reduces bias).\n",
